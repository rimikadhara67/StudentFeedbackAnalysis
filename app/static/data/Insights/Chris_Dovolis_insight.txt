Given the reasonable number of student ratings, the following insights can be considered relatively reliable and actionable:

**Strengths:**

* **Knowledgeable and Passionate:** Students consistently praise Prof. Dovolis's deep knowledge of computer science and his enthusiasm for the subject.  His teaching style is even compared to Bill Nye, suggesting engaging delivery.
* **Structured Class with Relevant Content:**  The course structure and content are generally well-received, considered relevant to future careers, and provide good talking points for internships.
* **Accessible TAs and Support:** The TA support system is frequently highlighted as a significant strength, particularly helpful with challenging projects.
* **Clear Grading Criteria:**  Most students appreciate the clarity of the grading scheme, even if they disagree with specific grading decisions.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Lecture Delivery and Slides:** While some find his lectures engaging, a recurring complaint is a lack of detail in lecture slides, making review challenging.  Tangents and rambling are also mentioned, impacting focus and note-taking.  Consider providing more structured slides with key concepts and code examples, and consciously minimizing tangents. Recording lectures and providing them online could also allow students to revisit specific topics.
* **Project Difficulty and Instructions:** Projects are described as overly complex, time-consuming, and with vague instructions.  While they are praised for their learning potential, streamlining the projects and providing clearer expectations and more detailed instructions would improve the student experience.
* **Exam Difficulty and Lack of Curve:**  A significant concern is the difficulty of exams, coupled with the professor's refusal to curve grades, even with low averages. While practice exams are provided, the lack of answer keys hinders effective preparation. Consider reviewing exam difficulty and exploring options like curving or providing more comprehensive review materials with solutions.
* **Accessibility and Inclusivity:**  Concerns were raised regarding accessibility for students with disabilities and inflexibility with exam times for commuter students. Prioritizing accessibility accommodations and offering alternative exam times when possible is crucial for inclusivity.
* **Zybooks Integration:** While some find Zybooks helpful for extra credit, others question its value in exam preparation. Reassess the role of Zybooks and consider alternative supplementary materials or strategies if it consistently proves unhelpful.


**Specific Action Items:**

1. **Revise lecture slides:** Add more detail, code examples, and key takeaways to facilitate review and independent learning.
2. **Clarify project instructions:** Provide more specific requirements, examples, and clearer expectations to reduce confusion and frustration.
3. **Review exam difficulty and grading:** Consider curving grades or adjusting exam content to better reflect student understanding.  Provide answer keys or more comprehensive review solutions.
4. **Improve accessibility and flexibility:**  Prioritize disability accommodations and explore alternative exam times or formats to accommodate diverse student needs.
5. **Evaluate Zybooks effectiveness:** Determine if Zybooks effectively supports learning and exam preparation, and consider alternatives if necessary.
6. **Solicit Mid-Semester Feedback:** Implement a mid-semester feedback mechanism to address concerns and adjust teaching strategies proactively.


By addressing these areas for improvement while leveraging his strengths, Professor Dovolis can enhance the learning experience for all students and better achieve his educational goals. The significant number of ratings provides sufficient confidence in these insights, allowing for effective and targeted improvements.
