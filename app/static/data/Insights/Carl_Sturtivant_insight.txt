## Actionable Insights for Professor Carl Sturtivant based on Student Feedback (210 ratings)

Given the relatively high number of ratings (210), the following insights are likely to represent a reasonable reflection of student experiences and offer valuable areas for improvement:

**Key Areas of Concern:**

* **Theory-Heavy Lectures with Lack of Practical Application:**  Students consistently report that lectures are heavily focused on theory and proofs, making it difficult to grasp the practical applications of linear algebra, especially within a computer science context. This disconnect leads to memorization for quizzes rather than genuine understanding and the ability to apply the concepts.
* **Difficult Textbook and Homework:** The chosen textbook is considered challenging, and homework assignments, while low-weight, are perceived as difficult and requiring significant effort.  Students often rely on TAs and external resources like "unstuck study AI" for support.
* **Limited Helpfulness during Q&A:** Some students feel their questions are not adequately addressed during lectures, finding discussion sections or self-study more beneficial.
* **Delayed Grading:**  A few students mentioned significant delays in grading quizzes and assignments, which can hinder learning and create anxiety.
* **Inconsistent Lecture Style:** Some find the lectures clear and insightful, while others describe them as "haphazard," "tough to understand," and lacking examples.  This suggests potential inconsistency in lecture delivery or varying student learning styles.


**Actionable Steps for Improvement:**

1. **Bridge the Gap between Theory and Application:** Incorporate more practical examples and real-world applications of linear algebra within computer science into lectures.  Demonstrate how the theoretical concepts translate into practical problem-solving.
2. **Review Textbook Choice and Homework Design:** Consider alternative textbooks that might be more accessible to students. Review homework assignments for difficulty and ensure they reinforce lecture material effectively. Provide more in-class guidance or supplementary resources to support student learning.
3. **Enhance Q&A Effectiveness:**  Allocate more time for questions and answers during lectures.  Practice techniques for clarifying student questions and providing helpful responses.  Consider alternative methods for gathering student questions (e.g., online platforms) to address them more efficiently.
4. **Improve Grading Timeliness:** Implement strategies for more efficient grading, potentially by utilizing TAs more effectively or adopting online grading platforms. Communicate grading timelines clearly to students.
5. **Strive for Consistent and Engaging Lecture Delivery:** Aim for consistent clarity and structure in lectures.  Incorporate more examples, visuals, and interactive elements to engage students and reinforce understanding. Regularly solicit student feedback on lecture effectiveness and adapt accordingly.
6. **Address Comments about Lecture Recording Access:** Consider making lecture recordings readily available to students without a substantial fee.  This can provide valuable support for those who struggle to grasp concepts during live lectures or need to review the material.


**Additional Notes:**

* While the majority of comments regarding the professor's personality are positive (funny, nice), there are a few mentions of unhelpful or rude responses to questions. This warrants attention and reflection on communication styles during student interactions.
* The comment about charging for lecture videos is concerning and should be addressed. Access to learning materials should ideally be equitable for all students.

By addressing these actionable insights, Professor Sturtivant can significantly enhance the learning experience for his students and promote a deeper understanding of linear algebra within a computer science context.  Regularly soliciting and analyzing student feedback will be essential for ongoing improvement and adapting to the evolving needs of the student body.
