## Actionable Insights for Professor Pen-Chung Yew based on Student Feedback (33 Ratings)

**Caveat:** While 33 ratings provide a reasonable basis for initial analysis, it's not a large sample size. These insights should be considered preliminary and corroborated with additional data gathering methods (e.g., course evaluations, direct student conversations) for a more robust understanding.

**Key Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Lecture Delivery and Engagement:**
    * **Action:** Move away from solely reading slides. Incorporate more interactive elements like examples, real-world applications, and problem-solving sessions relevant to homework and exams. Encourage student participation and questions.
    * **Rationale:** Students consistently report lectures as dry, unengaging, and unhelpful.  They feel the professor simply reads off slides without adding value or clarifying concepts.  Improving lecture quality is crucial for student learning and satisfaction.
2. **Clarity and Accessibility:**
    * **Action:** Explore strategies to improve clarity of speech, such as slowing down, enunciating more clearly, or using a microphone. Provide clear explanations of complex concepts. Offer additional support materials (e.g., annotated slides, supplementary notes) to enhance understanding.
    * **Rationale:**  Some students struggle to understand the professor due to his accent. This creates a barrier to learning and necessitates extra effort from students to grasp the material.
3. **Connecting Lectures to Assessments:**
    * **Action:** Ensure better alignment between lecture content and homework/exam questions. Provide more practice problems and examples that directly reflect the types of questions students will encounter on assessments.
    * **Rationale:**  Students express frustration that lectures don't adequately prepare them for assessments. They often resort to self-studying from the textbook, highlighting a disconnect between classroom instruction and evaluation.
4. **Lab and Homework Support:**
    * **Action:** While TAs are mentioned as helpful, consider providing more structured support for labs and homework assignments. This could involve clearer instructions, more frequent check-ins, or additional resources for struggling students.
    * **Rationale:**  Labs are perceived as difficult and time-consuming. Although online resources are apparently available, it's important to ensure academic integrity and provide official support channels to help students succeed without resorting to potentially unauthorized solutions.
5. **Course Pacing and Difficulty:**
    * **Action:** Carefully consider the pacing of the course, particularly the introduction of new material before assessments.  Explore ways to scaffold learning and provide opportunities for students to catch up if needed. Review the difficulty of exams, considering the average scores and student feedback.
    * **Rationale:** Students mention the fast pace and difficulty of the material, particularly with Verilog for those lacking prior experience. Addressing these issues can reduce student stress and improve overall learning outcomes.

**Positive Aspects to Maintain:**

* **Curved Grading:**  Students appreciate the generous curve, recognizing that it mitigates the difficulty of the course.  Maintain this practice to ensure fairness and acknowledge the challenges posed by the material.
* **Textbook Alignment:**  The alignment between the textbook and course content seems to be helpful for students who rely on self-study.  Continue leveraging the textbook as a valuable resource.

**Further Investigation:**

* Explore the reasons behind the low RMP rating and address any underlying issues contributing to this perception.
* Gather more data through end-of-semester evaluations and student focus groups to gain a more comprehensive understanding of student experiences and refine improvement strategies.
