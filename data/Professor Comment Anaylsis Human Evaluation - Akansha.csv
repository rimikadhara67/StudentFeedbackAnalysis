Phillip Barry (2011),2011 was harder than it should've been. I found myself bored in lecture and relied on the book for better understanding & practice. Homeworks were graded a bit harsh and at times were incredibly hard for no reason. TAs couldn't help much on the homeworks due to him not having the answer keys. Exams were open note & not too difficult of problems.,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer. It's unfortunate because there is a lot of very interesting material but it's integrated in the most uncreative way possible for a course such as this one. Exams and essays are also not trivial and there is a substantial amount of busy work. Take advantage of extra credit if you want an A.,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,
,"He's a good professor and lecturer, it's just hard to understand some topics from time to time. I would recommend just slightly looking at the textbook ahead of time to get an idea of the material, and then go to lecture and things should go well. The class is just dummy hard because the homework is graded very, very harshly. Good luck.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"He is a great lecturer, but the class itself is incredibly difficult. He only puts 34% on exams, which are already open note/book. Homework (33%) is very difficult, but most if not all problems can be figured out by looking through the book. The weekly quizzes (33%) are easy since they are open note as well, and ask easier questions than homework.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"I liked this class. I think you'll dislike it if you don't enjoy reading, writing, or history. Barry picked good topics and the class was well-structured. I agree with the other commenter. I watched Barry on 2x speed and I would struggle with staying attentive if it were in person. There was lots of opportunity for gimme points and extra credit.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,
,"Prof. Barry is the reason that that 2x speed button was invented. Decent lectures, but very (very) slow. This wasn't a big deal because I could just speed up the video, but I'm not sure I'd want to take an in-person class with him. The content of the course is pretty boring, but that's not really the fault of the professor. Lots of busy work.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,

,"This professor has been given some very interesting and varied content for this class. The method of engaging with the content, however, is exhaustingly boring. Discussing ethical and philosophical ideas with classmates has been reduced to a text crawl of soundbites thanks to overuse of a platform called Menti. Be prepared for some boring lectures.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,
,"Barry is a nice person but he grades harshly. He gave about an 80% avg grade in my course which is a B-. He seems to think that these are good grades but I think a lot of people were surprised and frustrated. If you want an easy A don't take him. Also, the course content was eh.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,
Phillip Barry (3921W),Professor Barry gave boring lectures that were hard to follow and honestly you're probably better off just reading the book and not attending lectures. Homework was graded very harshly but the weekly quizzes were pretty easy. The first half of this class was hard and annoying but it gets better.,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Homework was graded very harshly. Lectures were pretty good and I could generally follow them. He was a bit messy/unprepared (editing slides during lecture, not having answers to problems during lecture just explaining generally how to do it) but it didn't detract from it much. Overall good professor and good at teaching.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,
Phillip Barry (4921),"Professor Barry is a solid professor and structures his class well. This class is time-consuming and you are more or less independently learning, but you are given all the tools to succeed.

Be diligent with readings, homework, and labs and you'll do well.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Prof. Barry is a solid choice. Really nice guy, but his lectures are boring. He regurgitates the textbook and it's often not worth your time. You can learn the material through doing the labs and homework - both are fairly time consuming. However, tests and quizzes are pretty easy if you know what's going on with them.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,

His lecture did make those smart students move faster. Unfortunately, the faster they move, the harder for me to catch up.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,
,"Professor is quite fair. He drops one midterm, one hw, and two in-class exercises, which is great. Hw is rather hard and time consuming but you need to know how to do it for the tests. Lectures are pretty dull, and I hated in-class exercises. Stopped attending and started just teaching myself. But I did review lectures online. Take him if you can.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
Abhishek Chandra,"Professor Chandra is one of the best CSCI professors at the Twin-Cities campus.

,"He was a solid guy, his lab team was disorganized, but he accounted for that by granting an extension for every single project. Quizzes and tests, are easier than the other profs who offer this course so, if you're not a good test taker and can do alright on projects he's your guy.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Chandra himself gave clear lectures, albeit sometimes lacking detail. That being said, the administrative parts of this course were terrible, and there were a lot of issues with TA-related tasks like grading, project clarity, and labs starting late or not at all. Chandra ignored or complained when students brought up these issues. Do not recommend.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Good at lecturing in a beginner-friendly way, although the lectures aren't particularly attention-holding. Only complaint is that lab instructions are sometimes unclear and especially for the networking topics hard to understand what we were doing. Star Trek references on quizzes were a good bonus.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,
,"Chandra's lectures are very clear and understandable, a lot of the times he can just talk and walks through examples of topics to make sure we get what's happening (although can get a bit boring at times), labs and quizzes were straightforward, group projects were tough but manageable, midterms weren't too difficult.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Class was super interesting, his style of teaching is going over slides and examples sometimes. At least for me the way he taught and set the class up made me successful.

,Good professor with a sense of humor. Most of the content for exams are on his slides (also attend/watch his lectures. He tends to give examples/more info that isn't on the slides). There are four group projects (40% of the grade). Projects aren't bad if you find good partners.

I would take any class with him again.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,
,"This professor's lectures and slides are consistent, allowing you to prepare for lecture beforehand with questions and notes.

Very patient professor.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Chandra is a decent professor. I went into OS thinking it was going to be a big weed-out class, but it was honestly fairly easy as you're relearning the same concept throughout the semester. Chandra's lectures are dry, but they are very clear and you don't need to do much to understand them. My only advice is start projects early! Also get a group!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
,"Chandra has very clear lectures and lecture slides. They may not be the most engaging, but they are not confusing. The group projects were awful, a lot depends on your group members.

There were extra credit opportunities.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,
