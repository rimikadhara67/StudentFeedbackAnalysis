Professor Hyun Soo Park - Actionable Insights (10 Ratings)

**Caution:** The low number of ratings (10) limits the reliability of these insights.  Further data is needed to confirm these trends.

**Strengths:**

* **Passionate and Knowledgeable:** Students consistently praise Professor Park's expertise and enthusiasm for his subject matter, particularly Computer Vision.
* **Engaging Examples:**  He effectively connects course material to real-world applications, inspiring students.
* **Accessible and Friendly:** Students appreciate his approachability during office hours and his general kindness.
* **Fair Assessments (Generally):**  Quizzes, midterms, and the final are generally considered fair if students pay attention in class and utilize the textbook.  A cheat sheet is allowed, which aids students.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Project Expectations:**  The overwhelming consensus is that project expectations are excessively high, requiring students to surpass published research papers.  This creates significant difficulty, even for students with prior deep learning experience.  Consider revising project scope and providing more scaffolding or intermediate milestones.
* **Lecture Clarity and Pace:**  While entertaining, lectures are often described as rushed, unclear, and lacking in practical application.  The high level of abstraction and mathematical focus make it difficult for students to connect the lectures to homework assignments.  Consider incorporating more concrete examples, slowing down the pace, and focusing on practical application of concepts.
* **Slide Design:**  While visually appealing, slides are sometimes criticized for containing too many visualizations, which can obscure key ideas.  Streamlining slides to emphasize core concepts would improve their effectiveness.
* **Deep Learning Prerequisite Knowledge:** The project's difficulty stems partly from the assumption of prior deep learning framework mastery.  Clearly communicating prerequisites and offering introductory resources could better prepare students.
* **Perceived Condescension:** Some students perceive Professor Park as condescending, though this is not a universal sentiment.  Reflecting on communication style and ensuring a respectful learning environment is important.


**Action Plan:**

1. **Re-evaluate Project Scope:**  Reduce the ambition of the projects to a more manageable level for students. Offer more support, such as breaking down the project into smaller, more achievable milestones.
2. **Refine Lecture Delivery:** Focus on clarity and practical application. Slow down the pace, explain concepts more thoroughly, and connect them directly to homework assignments. Provide more concrete examples and less abstract theory.
3. **Improve Slide Design:** Reduce the number of visualizations per slide to highlight key takeaways. Consider adding more textual explanations to clarify complex concepts.
4. **Clarify Prerequisites:**  Explicitly state the required deep learning background and offer resources for students who need to catch up. Consider adding an introductory module on deep learning frameworks.
5. **Seek Feedback on Communication Style:** Regularly solicit student feedback to identify and address any perceived condescension. Encourage open communication and create a supportive classroom environment.


By addressing these areas, Professor Park can build upon his strengths and create a more effective and positive learning experience for his students.  Regularly collecting student feedback will be crucial for monitoring progress and making further adjustments.
