**Actionable Insights for Professor Yao-Yi Chiang (with cautionary note)**

Given the extremely limited number of ratings (3), the following insights should be interpreted with extreme caution and should not be considered definitive.  More data is needed to draw reliable conclusions.  These points represent potential areas for improvement and further investigation, *not* confirmed issues.

**Strengths:**

* **Reasonable Expectations and Helpful Preparation:** Students appreciate the reasonable expectations and find the practice exams beneficial for preparing for the actual exams.
* **Willingness to Help and Offer Extensions:** The professor appears willing to help students succeed and offer extensions when needed.
* **Relevant and Applicable Homework:** Homework, despite being challenging, is considered relevant and applicable to the course content.
* **Helpful Examples:**  The professor provides helpful examples in class.


**Areas for Potential Improvement (requiring further investigation):**

* **Clarity and Understanding of Course Material:** The comment about not making the slides and sometimes seeming unsure of the material needs further investigation. Does this relate to specific topics, or a general perception?
* **Homework and Project Grading:** The strict grading criteria, particularly the all-or-nothing approach to homework and projects, might be demotivating. Exploring options for partial credit, especially for demonstrating understanding even with imperfect code, could be considered.
* **Accessibility Outside of Class:**  Limited professor accessibility outside of class, with reliance on TAs (who are not always helpful), could be a barrier for some students. Exploring additional office hours or online communication options could improve accessibility.
* **Quiz Frequency:** Weekly quizzes might be perceived as burdensome. Consider the purpose and value of the quizzes and explore alternatives if appropriate.
* **Mental Health Considerations:** The comment regarding limited understanding of mental health concerns raises a flag. While one comment does not confirm a pattern, it warrants attention.  Ensuring clear communication about accommodation procedures and fostering a supportive classroom environment is essential.

**Next Steps:**

* **Gather More Feedback:** The most critical next step is to gather significantly more student feedback to validate these initial observations.
* **Targeted Questions:**  Include specific questions in future evaluations to address the identified areas: clarity of explanations, perceived difficulty of homework, satisfaction with TA support, and effectiveness of quizzes.
* **Open Dialogue with Students:** Facilitate open dialogue with students to discuss their experiences and concerns in a safe and constructive manner.

**Important Note:** Due to the very small sample size, these insights are highly susceptible to bias and might not accurately represent the overall student experience.  It is crucial to collect more data before drawing firm conclusions or implementing significant changes based on these preliminary findings.
