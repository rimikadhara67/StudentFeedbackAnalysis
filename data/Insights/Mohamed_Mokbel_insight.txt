## Actionable Insights for Professor Mohamed Mokbel based on Student Feedback (20 ratings)

**Caveat:** The relatively low number of ratings (20) means these insights might not fully represent the student experience.  Further data collection is recommended to confirm these trends.

**Strengths:**

* **Effective lectures and assignments:**  Students generally find lectures effective and assignments reasonable and helpful for learning.  This suggests the core teaching methodology is sound.
* **Fair grading and lenient policies:**  Lenient grading and fair assessment practices are appreciated by students.
* **Passionate and knowledgeable:** Students recognize and value Professor Mokbel's passion for the subject and deep knowledge.
* **Helpful and caring:**  Professor Mokbel is perceived as caring about student success and willing to help them understand the material, particularly during office hours.
* **Clear explanations:** Some students praise the clarity of explanations provided during lectures.
* **Helpful TAs:** Positive feedback regarding TA responsiveness and helpfulness is a significant asset.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Accent and clarity of speech:**  Professor Mokbel's accent is consistently mentioned as a significant barrier to understanding.  Working on pronunciation and pacing of speech could significantly improve student comprehension.
* **Connection between lectures, homework, and exams:**  Students report a disconnect between lecture content, homework assignments, and exam questions.  Aligning these three aspects of the course more closely will improve learning and reduce student frustration. Specifically, address the issue of testing on material from homework due *after* the test.  This prevents students from receiving feedback and applying it to their exam performance.
* **Slide quality and usage:**  Slides are described as sometimes being too brief, incomplete, or older versions.  Improving slide content and using them more effectively during lectures (e.g., not skipping ahead or revealing information too quickly) will enhance student learning. Writing on the board legibly along with presenting slides can also be helpful.
* **Availability of practice exams:** The lack of practice exams creates anxiety and makes it difficult for students to gauge their understanding of the material before exams.  Providing practice exams or sample questions would significantly improve exam preparation.
* **Difficulty of Lab 2:** The notably higher difficulty of Lab 2 compared to other labs should be examined.  Consider adjusting the difficulty or providing additional support for students during this lab.
* **Accessibility of resources and homework support:**  Students sometimes struggle to find resources and support to complete homework assignments.  Providing more accessible resources or clearer guidance could alleviate this issue.


**Actionable Recommendations:**

1. **Speech coaching:** Consider seeking speech coaching or utilizing resources to improve clarity of pronunciation and pacing. Recording lectures and reviewing them could also be beneficial.
2. **Curriculum alignment:** Carefully review the alignment between lecture content, homework assignments, and exam questions. Ensure that exams assess material covered in lectures and previous homework.  Shift the homework due dates to *before* related exams.
3. **Slide revision and presentation:** Update and improve slide content, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and current. Practice presenting the slides in a clear and organized manner, avoiding skipping ahead or rushing through material.
4. **Provide practice exams:**  Create and distribute practice exams or sample questions to help students prepare for exams and gauge their understanding.
5. **Review Lab 2:** Evaluate the difficulty of Lab 2 and consider adjusting its content or providing additional support resources.
6. **Improve resource accessibility:**  Provide clearer guidance on available resources for homework and ensure they are easily accessible to students. Compile a comprehensive list of helpful resources, both internal and external.

By addressing these areas for improvement, Professor Mokbel can further enhance the learning experience for students and build upon existing strengths.  Continued monitoring of student feedback will be crucial for ongoing improvement.
