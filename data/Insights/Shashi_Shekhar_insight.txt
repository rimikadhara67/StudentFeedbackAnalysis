## Actionable Insights for Professor Shashi Shekhar based on Student Feedback (25 ratings)

**Caveat:** The relatively small sample size of 25 ratings necessitates caution in interpreting these insights.  While trends are apparent, they may not fully represent the entire student population's experience. Further data collection would strengthen the reliability of these findings.

**I. Course Content and Structure:**

* **Overemphasis on Exams:** Students consistently report that exams carry excessive weight compared to homework, contributing significantly to their final grade. This creates high-stakes pressure and may not accurately reflect overall learning.  *Action:* Re-evaluate the grading distribution to balance exams with other assessment methods like projects, quizzes, or more substantial homework assignments.

* **Irrelevant Content:**  The perceived disconnect between course content and practical data science applications, coupled with the questionable categorization as a CSCI course (appearing more like GIS), needs addressing. *Action:*  Clarify the course's learning objectives and explicitly connect them to relevant data science skills. If the course is truly GIS-focused, its classification should be revised.  Consider incorporating case studies or guest lectures from industry professionals to demonstrate practical applications.

* **Lack of Depth & Practical Application:**  Lectures are criticized for covering many topics superficially, without providing sufficient depth or practical problem-solving approaches.  *Action:* Prioritize fewer topics and explore them in greater detail, incorporating hands-on exercises, coding examples, and real-world applications.

* **Outdated Material:** Some students perceive the course content as outdated, hindering their preparation for current industry practices.  *Action:*  Review the curriculum and update it with relevant technologies, tools, and industry trends.

**II. Teaching Methodology and Delivery:**

* **Unengaging Lectures:**  Students overwhelmingly describe lectures as "dry," "boring," "snooze fests," and "pointless," leading to poor attendance.  *Action:* Adopt more interactive teaching methods like in-class discussions, group activities, and real-time coding demonstrations. Explore incorporating multimedia elements or flipped classroom approaches.

* **Textbook Utilization:** Despite authoring the textbook, the professor's perceived underutilization of it creates confusion and disconnect.  *Action:*  Clearly align lectures with the textbook, referencing specific chapters and sections, and assign readings to reinforce concepts.

* **Poor Organization and Communication:**  The course is frequently described as "disorganized," "unprofessional," and lacking clear communication.  Issues with errors in exams, homework, and solutions further compound this problem. *Action:* Implement a more structured approach to course management, including a well-organized website, clear grading rubrics, and timely communication of any changes or corrections. Streamline communication channels and ensure consistency among TAs.

**III. Assessment and Grading:**

* **Exam Difficulty and Length:** Students find exams excessively long, time-consuming, and covering too much material, often including topics not adequately addressed in lectures.  *Action:*  Re-evaluate the length and scope of exams to ensure they align with lecture content and allow reasonable completion time. Consider providing practice exams or study guides.

* **Homework Effectiveness:** While homework is considered "easy," its low weightage renders it inconsequential for the final grade. *Action:* Increase the weight of homework or introduce more challenging assignments that require deeper engagement with the material.

* **Grading Transparency:**  Students express concerns about vague grading criteria. *Action:* Provide clear and detailed rubrics for all assignments and exams to ensure transparency and help students understand expectations.


**IV. Professor-Student Interaction:**

* **Conflicting Perceptions of Professor:** While some students describe Professor Shekhar as a "caring" and "nice guy," others find him "rude" and "condescending." This discrepancy highlights the need for more consistent and positive student interaction. *Action:*  Focus on building rapport with students, actively soliciting feedback, and addressing concerns respectfully. Consider participating in teaching development workshops focused on effective communication and classroom management.

* **TA Effectiveness:** While one student praises the helpfulness of the TA, others suggest inconsistency in TA support and knowledge.  *Action:*  Ensure all TAs are well-trained on the course material and grading guidelines. Implement regular meetings with TAs to address student feedback and maintain consistent support.



By addressing these actionable insights, Professor Shekhar can significantly improve the student learning experience and create a more engaging and effective learning environment.  Continuous monitoring of student feedback is crucial for ongoing improvement.
