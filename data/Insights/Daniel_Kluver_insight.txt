**Data Considerations:**

While 63 ratings provide a reasonable basis for analysis, it's crucial to acknowledge that this sample size may not fully represent the entire student population. Continued feedback collection and analysis are essential for ongoing improvement. Sentiment analysis indicates generally positive sentiment, but the relatively high disgust score (0.164) warrants further investigation to understand its source. This could be linked to the comments about attitude and communication style.


By addressing these actionable insights, Professor Kluver can further enhance his teaching effectiveness and create a more positive and supportive learning environment for all students.
