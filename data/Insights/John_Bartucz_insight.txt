This positive rapport likely contributes to a positive learning environment.  *Action:* Continue fostering a supportive classroom atmosphere.  Consider implementing regular check-ins with students to gauge their understanding and address concerns.

This transparency helps reduce student anxiety and promotes fairness.  *Action:* Continue explicitly stating assignment expectations and grading criteria. Provide rubrics whenever possible.

Clearly articulate the rationale behind the high standards and emphasize the skills students will gain.

**Data Considerations:**

* **Limited Data:**  The small sample size (3 ratings) limits the reliability of these insights.  Trends observed in the data may not represent the experiences of the broader student population. *Action:* Actively encourage more students to provide feedback through RMP, course evaluations, or other feedback mechanisms.
* **Sentiment Score vs. Qualitative Feedback:** While the sentiment score is positive (0.83), the qualitative feedback provides more specific and actionable information. *Action:* Prioritize analyzing the qualitative feedback to understand the nuances of student experience. Use sentiment analysis as a supplementary tool.
