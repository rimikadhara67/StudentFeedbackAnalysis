**Key Areas for Improvement:**

* **Lecture Clarity and Engagement:**  A recurring theme is the lack of clarity and engaging delivery in lectures. Students report monotone delivery, incomplete examples, excessive theory/math focus with insufficient application, and a lack of clear lecture plans.  The transition to online teaching appears to have exacerbated these issues.
* **Bridging the Gap Between Lecture and Homework:**  Students find the homework significantly more challenging than the lectures suggest.  This disconnect likely stems from incomplete examples in lectures and a lack of clear connections between theoretical concepts and their practical application.
* **Homework Clarity and Feedback:** Several students mention unclear homework assignments and a lack of feedback, leaving them unsure of their understanding.  This combination of challenging homework and limited feedback can be demotivating.
* **Course Structure and Planning:** Students express frustration with the perceived lack of a structured lesson plan. This contributes to the feeling that lectures are disjointed and important topics are missed or glossed over.
