Given the moderate number of ratings (37), these insights should be considered directional and require further investigation before significant changes are implemented.  There's enough data to identify trends, but not enough to be fully confident in the nuanced interpretations.

**Strengths:**

* **Engaging and Clear Lectures:** Students consistently praise Prof. Janardan's ability to explain complex concepts clearly and make lectures engaging, especially during in-person sessions with whiteboard use.  His slides are also described as detailed and self-contained.
* **Dedication and Accessibility:**  He's perceived as dedicated to his students and readily accessible, willing to help students understand the material through office hours.
* **Challenging but Rewarding:**  Many students find his class challenging but valuable, noting that they learned a lot and felt better prepared for advanced courses.
* **Well-Prepared:** Prof. Janardan is consistently described as well-prepared for his lectures.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Difficulty and Grading:**  A recurring theme is the high difficulty of the course, homeworks, and exams, particularly in the honors section (2011H). The lack of a grading curve and low average exam scores are frequent concerns.  Consider exploring options for adjusting difficulty, implementing a curve or more lenient grading policies, especially given student feedback about TA struggles with the material.
* **Online Transition Challenges:** The shift to online instruction appears to have negatively impacted the learning experience, with students expressing preference for in-person whiteboard lectures.  Explore strategies to improve online engagement and clarity, potentially incorporating more interactive elements or recorded explanations.
* **TA Support:**  Students report that the TAs, especially undergraduate TAs, are often unhelpful and struggle with the material themselves.  Investing in better TA training and support could significantly improve the student experience.
* **Curriculum Balance (2011H):**  Concerns were raised about the curriculum of the honors section (2011H) deviating significantly from the non-honors version, potentially affecting overall readiness. A review of the curriculum alignment and learning outcomes for both sections is recommended.
* **Homework Load:** While appreciated for reinforcing concepts, the homework load is considered substantial. Consider reviewing the number and complexity of assignments, ensuring they are manageable and contribute effectively to learning without becoming overly burdensome.

**Actionable Steps:**

1. **Solicit Specific Feedback:** Conduct anonymous surveys or focus groups to gather more detailed feedback on specific aspects of the course, particularly the online experience, homework load, and TA support.
2. **Review Grading Practices:**  Analyze grade distributions and consider implementing a curve or adjusting grading policies, especially for exams, to ensure fairness and reduce student stress.
3. **Invest in TA Training:** Provide TAs with more comprehensive training on the course material and grading rubrics, empowering them to better support students.
4. **Enhance Online Instruction:** Explore ways to make online lectures more engaging and effective, potentially incorporating interactive elements, recorded whiteboard explanations, or other supplementary materials.
5. **Evaluate 2011H Curriculum:**  Compare the learning outcomes and content of the honors and non-honors sections of 2011 to ensure alignment and address any gaps in overall readiness.

By addressing these areas, Professor Janardan can build on his strengths and further enhance the student learning experience.  The moderate number of ratings highlights the importance of ongoing feedback collection and iterative improvement.
